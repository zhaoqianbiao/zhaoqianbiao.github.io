The app runs correctly and passes all the tests. The problem is that I am not confident about what I actually learned or truly understood.\nBefore this course, I had some experience developing a Windows application using C# and WinUI 3, and I had been exposed to concepts such as event-driven programming and callbacks. However, even after completing MP1, MP2, and MP3 over several weeks, my understanding of these concepts still felt shallow. I often knew how to use them, but not why they worked the way they did.\nThis made me realize a deeper issue. If I still ended up in a “finished it but didn’t fully understand it” situation despite having some prior experience, the problem is likely to be amplified for students without a programming background who rely heavily on AI tools to complete an Android app.\nI agree that AI can explain many complex concepts, and in isolation those explanations often sound clear. However, for students who have not learned these ideas systematically, this can lead to understanding individual pieces without being able to connect them into a coherent whole. In practice, AI can easily shift from helping students understand code to simply helping them pass the autograder. A common pattern then becomes: failing a test, asking an AI to modify the code, and running it again. The focus gradually moves away from identifying gaps in understanding and toward optimizing for passing tests.\nThis is not a problem caused by students or by AI itself. Rather, it emerges from the combination of task design, the learning process, and the capabilities of AI tools, which together create a path where tasks can be completed without meaningful learning taking place.\nToward the end of the semester, Professor Challen expressed a similar reflection on the course forum. He noted that it is essentially impossible to both provide a detailed written specification for this type of assignment and teach students to use AI coding agents without allowing the agent to do most of the work. As a result, the course plans to replace the current scaffolded project with a more open-ended project in future semesters.\nLooking back on this machine project, I feel that what I gained most was not a specific technical skill, but a warning: there is a significant gap between completing tasks and truly understanding them.\n","categories":["My Perspecitve"],"tags":["AI","CS Education"]},{"title":"Worksheet Searching","url":"/2024/12/30/Worksheet-Searching/","content":"“The Best Software I’ve Ever Written Was for My Mom”\n\nOverviewA Windows Excel addin for searching relavent worksheet by name.\nThe ProblemWhen people work with excel files, there is no built-in function to search in hundreds of worksheets of different names.
